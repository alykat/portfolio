## I'm Alyson Hurt, a news graphics editor.

* I design **infographics** (maps, charts and other data visualizations) and **special presentations** tied to digital **news coverage**.
* I **coordinate and assign graphics** to accompany news and feature coverage.
* As needed, I serve as **project manager** and **editor**, shepherding graphics through the editorial process and editing colleagues' design and coding work.
* I've worked on a lot of **election coverage** -- particularly election results and how information is presented over the course of the news cycle.

I've spent most of my career at NPR, The Washington Post and The Arizona Republic. **[Here is my resume.](resume/)**

## Here are a few [projects]({{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}) I'm proud of:
