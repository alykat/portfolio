<h2>&quot;Anatomy of a NASCAR Race&quot;</h2>
<h4>azcentral.com/The Arizona Republic / Oct. 2000</h4>

<p>This Flash graphic was built in collaboration with the Republic art department. The base graphics (such as the detailed image of the stock car) were created by the art department and then imported into Flash and formatted for web use. I built the interface and two of the sections in this graphic.</p>
