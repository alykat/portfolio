<p>My boss and I launched two new Flash packages when U.S.-led forces began bombing targets in Afghanistan. The first was a map of Afghanistan highlighting areas with related news. My boss created the map, and as the bombing continued, I updated it almost daily. The second was a brief run-down of 20th century Middle East history. I had already been working on a Middle East timeline when the bombing in Afghanistan began, so I worked faster to complete it in order to launch the package Oct. 7.</p>
