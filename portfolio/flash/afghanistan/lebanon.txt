&countryinfo=Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since 1991 and the end of the devastating 16-year civil war. Since the end of the war, the Lebanese have conducted several successful elections, most of the militias have been weakened or disbanded and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) have extended central government authority over about two-thirds of the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains its weapons. Syria maintains about 25,000 troops here, based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.
