&countryinfo=Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq became an independent kingdom in 1932. A series of military strongmen have ruled the country since 1958. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly eight-year war (1980-1988). In August 1990 Iraq seized Kuwait, but was expelled by US/UN coalition forces in early 1991. Subsequently, the UN Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN inspections. UN trade sanctions remain in effect due to incomplete Iraqi compliance.
