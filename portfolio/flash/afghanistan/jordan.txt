&countryinfo=For most of its history since independence from Great Britain in 1946, Jordan was ruled by King Hussein (1953-1999). A pragmatic ruler, he successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel and a large internal Palestinian population through several wars and coup attempts. In 1989 he resumed parliamentary elections; in 1994 a formal peace treaty was signed with Israel. King Abdallah II - the eldest son of King Hussein and Princess Muna - assumed the throne following his father's death in 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and established his domestic priorities.
