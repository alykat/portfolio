2000 Highlights: Began the season on the DL as he recovered from off-season arthoscopic surgery on his right shoulder. Posted a 6.34 ERA in his first five decisions after his return, but improved as his strength returned. Went 5-2 with a 2.00 ERA in his last eight starts for the Phillies. Compiled a 3.69 ERA in 13 games as a D-Back, but only garnered a 5-6 record as the D-Backs struggled to support him with runs.
