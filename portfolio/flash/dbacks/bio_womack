2000 Highlights: Topped the NL in triples with a club record 14. Left knee injury nagged him in the latter months of the season. Still managed to finish fourth in the league with 45 stolen bases, the first time in four seasons he didn't win the NL stolen base crown. Saw other numbers drop below career averages, including batting average (.271) and a paltry on-base percentage (.307).
