Became the second manager in franchise history last October. Spent the previous three seasons as a member of the club's broadcasting team, as well as one of Fox Network's primary analysts. Was a major league catcher for nine years, nearly all of them with the San Francisco Giants.

Signed with the Giants after graduating from Ohio University in 1976. After over five years of minor league action, including the over two seasons with the Phoenix Giants, Brenly was summoned to San Francisco in August of 1981 for his big league debut. Hit a home run in his first at bat on Aug. 28, 1981, in Candlestick Park.

Best season was in 1984, when he was named to the All-Star team that summer while establishing career bests in virtually every category. Hit .291 in 145 games, including 20 home runs and 80 RBIs. Hit .316 for the first half of the season. Memorable moments include a game-winning, inside-the-park home run at Montreal on Aug. 29.
