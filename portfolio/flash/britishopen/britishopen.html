<!--The British Open Loading interactive graphic The British Open The Open Championship returns to the classic links  for the 15th time. The first four-round Open  was played at Muirfield in 1892. At this  year's tournament, Tiger Woods could  join Ben Hogan to become the only  other player in the gameís history to  win the first three professional majors.  Arnold Palmer in 1960 and Jack Nicklaus  in 1972 are the only others who had the  chance. Both failed at the British Open.

Playoff, if necessary: Four holes, stroke play. Open champions at Muirfield: Harold Hilton (1892), Harry Vardon  (1896), James Braid (1901, 1906),  Ted Ray (1912), Walter Hagen  (1929), Alfred Perry (1935), Henry  Cotton (1948), Gary Player (1959),  Jack Nicklaus (1966), Lee Trevino  (1972), Tom Watson (1980), Nick  Faldo (1987, 1992) Facts and figures Last year: Duval won his first major championship at Royal Lytham & St.  Annes. He had a 40 on the back nine Friday and was seven  strokes out of the lead, but a 65 in the third round put him a four- way tie for the lead. Duval closed with a 4-under 67 for a three- stroke victory over Niclas Fasth. Ian Woosnam was penalized two  strokes on the first hole of the final round for having 15 clubs in his  bag and finished four shots behind. Grand Slam: Tiger Woods is the first player to win the first two legs of the Grand  Slam since Nicklaus in 1972. Nicklausí bid for the Grand Slam  ended at Muirfield, where Trevino beat him by one shot in the  British Open. Ben Hogan in 1953 is the only player to win the  Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in the same season. Quoteworthy: ìIíve always believed all four could be won in one year, and now  that he has won the Masters and U.S. Open, everyone is kind of  intimidated, a bit scared, because Tiger has only one goal in mind.î - Greg Norman.
