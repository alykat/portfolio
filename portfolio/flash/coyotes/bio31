In his first season as an NHL head coach, Francis led the Coyotes to one of their best regular season records in franchise history. The Coyotes finished the 1999-2000 season with a 39-35-8-4 record.

The 41-year-old Francis joined the Coyotes after two successful seasons as an assistant coach with Boston. Under his direction, the Bruins special teams units were among the best in the NHL, ranking first in penalty killing (89.2 percent) and eighth in power play (17.7 percent).

Before his move to the coaching ranks, Francis played four years of college hockey at the University of New Hampshire. He signed on as a free agent with Calgary on Oct. 27, 1980 and was traded to the Detroit Red Wings on Dec. 2, 1982. Francis spent most of his professional career at the minor-league level.
