<p>My boss designed and I programmed a Flash-based graphic to keep track of medals won by U.S. athletes in the Sydney Olympics. Because this graphic would have to be updated daily, and from home on weekends, all information is stored in a series of text files, which the Flash movie then calls in.</p>
