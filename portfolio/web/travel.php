<p>When azcentral.com's partnership with the Arizona Office of Tourism ended Fall 2000, the powers that be decided a redesign of azcentral.com's own Travel &amp; Outdoors section was in order. The main goals of the redesign were to make the section as visually appealing and easy to navigate as possible, with an eye toward using the section as a moneymaking venture.</p>
<p>The site has since undergone an extensive redesign to bring its look more in line with the rest of azcentral.com, and to emphasize its more commercial aspects (i.e. travel booking).</p>
