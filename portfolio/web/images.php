<p>This client site was launched in March 2001 to accompany the premiere of &quot;Images of Arizona,&quot; a documentary piece by Tempe, Ariz.-based PBS station KAET. My contributions to this site included the inside page design, site templates and the Flash-based &quot;<a href="http://www.imagesofarizona.com/dejolie/experience.shtml">Experience</a>&quot; features within each photographer's section.</p>
