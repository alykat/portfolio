<h2>Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce</h2>
<h4>azcentral.com/The Arizona Republic / March 2000</h4>

<p>&raquo; <a href="http://www.phoenixchamber.com">View site</a> (external link)</p>

<p>The client wanted a completely revamped, database-driven site that was easy to update and easy to navigate. I created the site design based on the GPCC's styleguide for print publications, and the developers at azcentral.com built the site and admin tools using the Cold Fusion programming language.</p>
<p>Certain design elements of the site, especially the index page, have changed considerably since the initial launch.</p>
