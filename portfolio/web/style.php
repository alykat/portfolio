<p>YES was part of an Arizona Republic intiative to broaden its readership among the valuable 18-34 demographic. The print edition of YES is a weekly style magazine distributed in the Phoenix metro area. The web edition is updated daily with fresh content and features.</p>
<p>The initial design of this section was my first major freelance project for azcentral.com. With me in Virginia and the azcentral.com office in Phoenix, the design of this site was coordinated largely via e-mail, instant messaging and conference calls.</p>
<p>The second redesign of the section was spurred in large part by the <a href="azcentral.php">overall site redesign</a> that had taken place a few months earlier.</p>
