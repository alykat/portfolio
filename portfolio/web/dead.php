<p>azcentral.com's extensive &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; site was in need of both a facelift and a refreshing of content. I was commissioned to design the new site, using artwork created by a local Phoenix artist. I also designed a special teachers' packet for educators to use in their classes, artwork for site-related merchandise, a few Flash-based widgets and web ads for an online ad campaign to promote the new site.</p>
