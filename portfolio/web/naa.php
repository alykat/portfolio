<p>This is really only a partial site redesign: The home page and overall look have changed, but much of the overall structure, particularly on the section pages, has remained the same. The main goals of this project were to 1) make both featured and archived content easier to find and 2) from a visual standpoint, make the site more appealing and better representative of NAA's mission.</p>
