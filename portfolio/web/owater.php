<p>The client, a start-up water delivery business, wanted a database-driven site with a design that conveyed crispness, clarity and class. I designed the site with the client's existing print advertising styles in mind, keeping to a primarily black/blue color scheme using predominantly black-and-white photos. After the site design was completed, our developers built out the backend and admin functions using Cold Fusion.</p>
<p>Certain design elements of the site, especially the index page, have changed considerably since the initial launch.</p>
