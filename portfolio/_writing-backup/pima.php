            <h2>Pima College to open Northwest campus</h2>
            <h4>Northwest Explorer / May 1, 1997</h4>

            <p>Pima Community College is considering a new Northwest site at Arthur 
              Pack Golf Course and offering classes at nearby Mountain View High 
              School.</p>
            <p>Officials are proposing the new Northwest Pima campus in partnership 
              with Pima County, looking to Arthur Pack, at Thornydale Road and 
              Overton, as a likely site. Pima will identify the exact location 
              of the new campus by fall, and the facilities will take one to two 
              years to construct. The Northwest campus likely will not open for 
              at least two more years.</p>
            <p>Mt. View, immediately north at Thornydale and Linda Vista Blvd., 
              may host some Pima classes as early as this summer, with more classes 
              offered during the 1997-98 school year. Its course offerings should 
              be integrated into Mt. View's curriculum by the 1998-99 school year. 
              Pima may offer evening classes for the community starting August 
              27.</p>
            <p>&quot;I hesitate to say that (Mt. View) would be 'our campus,' 
              but it would be an active site for Pima instruction,&quot; George 
              Martinez said. Martinez is the Senior Assistant to the Chancellor 
              at Pima Community College. &quot;We have a great interest in partnering 
              with (Mt. View), but right now we're looking at establishing our 
              own campus at the Arthur Pack site.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Northwest campus will be a full campus, offering a full scope 
              of classes, as well as sports and extracurricular activities. It 
              may also have its own specialty, possibly using Environmental Science 
              as its anchor program.</p>
            <p>&quot;The Arthur Pack site has plenty of natural vegetation and 
              would be ideal for a number of courses, such as Geology and Botany,&quot; 
              Martinez said.</p>
            <p>At Mt. View, Pima initially hopes to offer a limited scope of remedial 
              and college freshman-level classes on the Mt. View campus. Its proposed 
              Fall 1997 class schedule includes courses in math, Western Civilization, 
              Spanish, sign language, psychology and freshman writing.</p>
            <p>Mt. View and Pima officials are also considering the possibility 
              of concurrent enrollment, in which Mt. View students can take classes 
              for both high school and Pima credit simultaneously. Pima-certified 
              Mt. View teachers may teach the courses, although Pima instructors 
              could also teach the classes for an extra cost.</p>
            <p>None of these plans have been finalized, as Pima's giverning board 
              still must vote on the proposals at its May 14 meeting.</p>
            <p>&quot;The Board still needs to look over this and vote. The Northwest 
              site is one of many proposals, but this new campus has strong support, 
              both within the [Pima] community and the community,&quot; Martinez 
              said.</p>
            <p>At least some Pima credits are accepted at all of the nation's colleges 
              except Brigham Young University, and there are concerns about what 
              Pima coursework applies at other colleges and universities. Mt. 
              View guidance counselor Hollis Hemingway advises parents and students 
              to investigate which credits will transfer.</p>
            <p>&quot;The responsibility rests on parents and students to do their 
              research,&quot; Hemingway said.</p>
            <p>&quot;They should talk to admissions offices about documentation 
              and any conceivable problems. Presently, there should be no problems 
              with using Pima credits in-state.&quot;</p>
            <p>With Pima's close proximity to the Mt. View campus, Mt. View principal 
              Lynn Edwards sees many possible changes within the Mt. View curriculum, 
              as well as a number of opportunities. For example, Pima may offer 
              Mt. View such services as placement testing and academic advisement, 
              as well as use of their own facilities.</p>
            <p>&quot;We're also talking about (Pima) being able to do some placement 
              testing with us to make sure that students are being placed in exactly 
              the right kinds of courses with PCC,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;If 
              a student needed support from an adviser, there would be a teleconferencing 
              technology available where a student would be able to sit at a computer 
              and be able to see and talk to a counselor down at one of the other 
              campuses.</p>
            <p>&quot;We're also excited about being able to use some of their 
              facilities and technology. For example, they have a very sophisitcated 
              television production studio. They are willing to let our students 
              come down and use that facility and serve internships, and that 
              would probably be at no cost to us.&quot;</p>
            <p>There is a possibility that current Mt. View Advanced Placement 
              (AP) classes could be gradually replaced with Pima classes. Students 
              could earn college credit simply by taking a class, rather than 
              gambling possible college credit on a test score. Also feasible 
              is a compromise between Pima and AP classes, where students take 
              the Pima courses and have the option of keeping their grade in the 
              class or taking the AP test, Hemingway said.</p>
            <p>Edwards cautions that there are no plans to end the AP program 
              at this time.</p>
            <p>&quot;There are no plans to do away with AP. Maybe down the road, 
              and it looks like that may be a natural evolution, but there are 
              no plans right now to do that,&quot; she said.</p>
            <p>With a past history of offering Pima courses on campus, Mt. View 
              has some concerns regarding fuding for the upkeep of its facilities, 
              but administrators already have plans in place to help resolve those 
              problems. Edwards will also hire a site coordinator to oversee Pima's 
              operations on the Mt. View campus and to handle Mt. View teacher 
              concerns. This person, a teacher, community member or administrator, 
              will be responsible for taking care of everything, she said.</p>
            <p>Another issue is certifying Mt. View teachers as Pima instructors. 
              Pima teachers must have a minimum of a master's degree and have 
              majored (or have substantial coursework completed) in the courses 
              they are teaching. Within three years, they must also take the Pima 
              class, &quot;The Community College.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Not all of our teachers have their master's. That could be 
              the biggest problem for us,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;Our qualifications 
              for AP teachers were that they were strong teachers in the subject 
              area they were teaching. There's quite a different philosophical 
              position.&quot;</p>
            <p>Overall, Edwards sees the arrrangement as a win-win situation for 
              both Mt. View and Pima.</p>
            <p>&quot;The advantage for (Pima in offering classes at Mt. View) 
              is that we've already got the building, the parking lot, the equipment 
              in the building; and with Pima's close proximity, the advantage 
              to Mt. View would be endless, limited only by our ability to visualize 
              and create ways in which they could support us,&quot; Edwards said.</p>
            <p>Martinez is enthusiastic about the site's convenience for local 
              residents.</p>
            <p>&quot;It think the opportunities are very exciting. A lot of our 
              Pima students come from the Mt. View areas to our West and Downtown 
              campuses. There is no question that a lot of people in the Northwest 
              area would love a local campus,&quot; he said.</p>
