            <h2>Tempe School District #3 meeting</h2>
            <h4>JRN 420 / March 7, 2000</h4>

            <p>Tempe School District #3’s teacher shortage has reached an &quot;emergency&quot; 
              state, the district school board said in a resolution at last night’s 
              meeting.</p>
            <p>Per state law, this formal resolution will allow the district to 
              hire qualified teachers who may be just shy of certification.</p>
            <p>Also, leaders of the Birth to Eight Initiative, aimed at preparing 
              the youngest children in the community for elementary school, presented 
              the program’s goals and current status to the school board.</p>
            <p>In other action, the board unanimously approved:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Awarding a $94,000 contract to Contractor’s Abatement Services, 
                Inc. for asbestos removal at Carminati and Hudson Schools.</li>
              <li>Renewing an agreement with the Maricopa County Social Services 
                Department for meal services for the Head Start Program during 
                the 2000-01 school year.</li>
              <li>Applying for a 21st Community Learning Center Grant with nearby 
                Kyrene Elementary Tempe Union High School districts.</li>
              <li>Accepting donated Internet filtering services by Dotsafe, Inc.</li>
              <li>Accepting a donated school marquee, valued at $4,700, from the 
                Carminati School PTA.</li>
              <li>Revising the 2000-01 school calendar to require new teachers 
                to start on August 10.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Tempe District #3 is one of many districts across the state that 
              have been having trouble finding qualified new teachers because 
              of the low unemployment rate.</p>
            <p>The school district’s formal declaration of an &quot;emergency&quot; 
              teacher hiring state will allow the district to hire prospective 
              teachers who are just shy of certification. Those &quot;emergency certifications&quot; 
              would be valid for one year to allow those teachers time to complete 
              their coursework for formal certification.</p>
            <p>The goal of the Birth to Eight Initiative is to prepare young children 
              – and their parents – for the school environment by adopting benchmarks 
              for child development and increasing awareness of available community 
              programs.</p>
            <p>&quot;We want to develop a program that really addresses that critical 
              time between ages zero and five,&quot; said Superintendent John 
              Baracy. Students would have to meet certain standards to begin school.</p>
            <p>Program organizers, with input from local community members, are 
              developing benchmarks for various stages of child development. They 
              are basing their standards, with some revisions, on the book &quot;Every 
              Step Counts,&quot; published by the Arizona Department of Education 
              for new parents.</p>
            <p>Tempe District #3, Tempe Union High School District and Kyrene 
              Elementary School District are collaborating on the project.</p>
            <p>Sara Glaeser, tri-district coordinator for the program, said she 
              hopes to have the program running at a limited level by September.</p>
