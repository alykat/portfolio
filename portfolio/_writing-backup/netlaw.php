            <h2>The First Amendment in Cyberspace</h2>
            <h4>MCO 402 / July 2, 1999</h4>

            <p>Cyberspace is a murky place where the legal world is concerned. 
              The legal system grapples uncomfortably with legislation regarding 
              new technologies, and since the explosion in popularity and prominence 
              of the Internet, the system has been faced with the awkward and 
              somewhat daunting task of applying existing laws to this global, 
              nebulous network. In their 1996 book <i>Sex, Laws and Cyberspace</i>, 
              Jonathan Wallace and Mark Mangan discuss existing Internet-related 
              caselaw as it relates to accountability and freedom of expression. 
              Their arguments paint the two as undeniably staunch supporters of 
              First Amendment rights on the Internet, but at the same time, they 
              offer valid criticisms and suggestions regarding the confusing, 
              often misunderstood world of the Information Superhighway.</p>
            <p>One of the most liberating &mdash; and potentially frightening &mdash; aspects 
              of the Internet is the ability for anyone with access to become 
              a publisher. Wallace and Mangan describe it as &quot;... this new 
              technology, this electronic, global Gutenberg printing press that 
              turns all citizens into publishers who can reach thousands and even 
              millions of people around the country and the world&quot; (Wallace 
              166). It is possibly the ultimate expression of the "free marketplace 
              of ideas" theory espoused first by John Stuart Mill and reiterated 
              years later by Justices Holmes and Brandeis in their dissent to 
              <i>Abrams v. United States</i> (1919). The Internet affords users 
              the ability to find and read information on various issues from 
              a wide range of viewpoints &mdash; and add their own perspectives, if 
              they wish.</p>
            <p>The Internet is an amazing resource for information on just about 
              any subject. What disturbs the legal system, as well as Congress, 
              is the prevalence of pornographic material among the more benign 
              information. A 1993 case marked a potentially troubling precedent 
              for the online pornography industry. <i>United States v. Thomas</i> 
              involved the conviction of a California couple, Robert and Carleen 
              Thomas, who were arrested by Tennessee authorities for the interstate 
              transport of pornographic materials via their Amateur Action Bulletin 
              Board Service, a members-only online warehouse of pornographic images 
              and videos. The couple was tried in a federal court in Tennessee, 
              and two of the pictures from their BBS were deemed legally obscene 
              per the <i>Miller</i> test. One especially troubling issue comes 
              from this ruling: One prong of the <i>Miller</i> test requires the 
              material in question to be "patently offensive" by local community 
              standards. The question is, in the online realm, what constitutes 
              a community? Wallace and Mangan argue for a new definition of "community":</p>
            <blockquote>Computer bulletin board technology requires the 
                application of a new definition of community. The wording of <i>Miller 
                </i>had not required that the standards applied be those of a 
                'geographical' community, and there was precedent in FCC regulations 
                and military law for the proposition that a Miller community did 
                not have to be geographically bound. (31-2)
            </blockquote>
            <p>Wallace and Mangan further verbalize their concerns regarding the 
              legal definition of "community" when they address the result of 
              the <i>Thomas</i> case: "By allowing the application of local standards 
              to a vast, instantaneous, worldwide entity like the Internet, <i>Miller 
              </i>now allows Memphis, in the heart of the Bible Belt, to apply 
              its conservatism forcibly on the rest of the world" (31).</p>
            <p>Wallace and Mangan instead propose a new idea: Allow the particular 
              community that deals with the Thomases' pornographic material &mdash; 
              in this case the AABBS members themselves &mdash; to judge what is patently 
              offensive to them.</p>
            <blockquote>The idea is that they are an insular group of 
                3,500 pornophiles who should be allowed to stew in their own smut 
                if they like. Such a result &mdash; the adoption of the standards of 
                the members of a cyberspace community to judge the obscenity of 
                which they are sympathetic users &mdash; would effectively repeal obscenity 
                laws entirely. Under such a scenario, as long as AABBS did not 
                offend its own members, and disseminated its material only to 
                adults who requested and paid for it, it would never be shut down. 
                (32)
            </blockquote>
            <p>This philosophy can also be likened to the Supreme Court's ruling 
              in <i>Stanley v. Georgia</i> (1969), in which the Court permitted 
              private use of obscene materials. By this rationale, pornography 
              can be allowed to flourish so long as minors are not permitted to 
              access it and no existing laws are broken in the dissemination or 
              production of the material.</p>
            <p>(Granted, such a policy would only apply in regards to prosecutions 
              by United States authorities in obscenity/pornography cases. The 
              global nature of the Internet creates a sticky situation in the 
              realm of international law, as, theoretically, the government of 
              Saudi Arabia could prosecute a webmaster in Texas for having content 
              they deemed indecent or obscene. There has not, as yet, been any 
              kind of resolution regarding such global liability issues.)</p>
            <p><i>United States v. Thomas </i>was only the start of the American 
              governmental assault on obscenity. Senator Exon first proposed the 
              Communications Decency Act in the United States Senate in 1994. 
              By 1996, he had gathered enough fuel for a full-fledged onslaught 
              on online obscenity. Specifically, his CDA prohibited the &quot;knowin[g]&quot; 
              sending or displaying to a person under 18 of any message &quot;that, 
              in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as 
              measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory 
              activities or organs.&quot; Exon went on the warpath against cyberspace 
              &mdash; and had an in-depth article in <i>Time</i> magazine to back up 
              in his claims that "83 percent of all images on the Internet were 
              pornographic" (Wallace 131).</p>
            <p>Wallace and Mangan go so far as to assert that public support for 
              the CDA was fueled largely by the <i>Time</i> article, support which, 
              in turn, led to the passage of the CDA in Congress and its signing 
              in to law. They also assert that the study upon which the <i>Time</i> 
              article was based was something of a fraud, and that by the time 
              it was finally discredited, it was too late.</p>
            <p>The infamous <i>Time</i> article from July 3, 1995 had a photo 
              of a wide-eyed child on its cover with the text "On a Screen Near 
              You: Cyberporn." The story inside was about an online pornography 
              study done by Carnegie Mellon University undergraduate Marty Rimm. 
              As part of his study, Rimm chose five Usenet newsgroups he deemed 
              pornographic and developed a computer program to analyze the descriptions 
              of each of these pictures to better understand the nature of pornography 
              posted to the Internet.</p>
            <blockquote>[Rimm] reported that "17 of the 32 alt.binaries 
                newsgroups located on the Usenet contained pornographic imagery. 
                Among the non-pornographic newsgroups, 827 image posts were counted 
                during the seven-day period. Among the pornographic newsgroups, 
                4,206 image posts were counted, or 83.5 percent of the total posts." 
                This passage led [<i>Time </i>magazine] and proponents of the 
                CDA later to claim that 83 percent of all images on the Internet 
                were pornographic. But, as critics would later point out, Rimm 
                had only counted the images in selected pornographic newsgroups. 
                (Wallace 131)
            </blockquote>
            <p>The congressmen likley misunderstood the widely varied nature of 
              the Internet and its mulitple forms when reading Rimm's analysis. 
              Bulletin boards and Usenet newsgroups, which the study focused on, 
              comprise only a small portion of the Internet. For his study, Rimm 
              never visited any pornographic web sites to include them in his 
              study of pornography &mdash; or any web sites at all, for that matter. 
              Nonetheless, pro-CDA senators took his words to heart and claimed 
              that his study represented <i>all</i> of cyberspace.</p>
            <p>Donna Hoffman and her husband Tom Novak, both professors at Vanderbilt 
              University, posted an exhaustive critique of the Rimm study soon 
              after its publication, criticizing the study for misrepresentation, 
              manipulation, lack of objectivity and methodological flaws.</p>
            <blockquote>We do not debate the existence of pornography 
                in &quot;cyberspace&quot; ... What we dispute are the findings 
                presented in this study concerning its extent and consumption 
                on what Rimm calls the &quot;Information Superhighway.&quot; The 
                critically important national debate over First Amendment rights 
                and restrictions on the Internet and other emerging media requires 
                facts and informed opinion, not hysteria. [<i>Time</i> had given 
                the study] a credibility it does not deserve. (Hoffman, qtd in 
                Wallace 141)
            </blockquote>
            <p>The Rimm study had been fully discredited within weeks after its 
              release. "But the damage had already been done &mdash; Senators Grassley 
              and Exon had waved the <i>Time </i>article around Congress; Senator 
              Coats had quoted Rimm's phony statistics" (151).</p>
            <p>The bill passed the Senate 84-16 and went on to the House for consideration. 
              The House revised the CDA to the milder Cox-Wyden bill, which provided 
              that "FCC regulation of the Intenet and other interactive computer 
              services is prohibited &mdash; nothing in this act shall be construed 
              to grant any jurisdiction or authority to the Commission with respect 
              to economic or content regulation of the internet or other interactive 
              computer services" (qtd in Wallace 189). The final bill also included 
              the seemingly innocuous Hyde Amendment, introduced by conservative 
              Republican Henry Hyde. Directed toward the protection of minors, 
              the Hyde amendment provided that "anyone transmitting via computer 
              'patently offensive' material depicting or describing 'sexual or 
              excretory activities or organs' could be imprisoned for five years" 
              (Wallace 190). The House approved the revised bill with the Hyde 
              provision, and President Clinton signed it into law.</p>
            <p>The CDA, now "legal," represented "a radical attack on the First 
              Amendment protection of free speech" and the Supreme Court's rules 
              interpreting the First Amendment. Wallace and Mangan made the following 
              argument:</p>
            <blockquote>First, the Court had established that the only 
                category of sex-related speech that was not protected by the First 
                Amendment is obscenity, defined as prurient, patently offensive 
                speech lacking in scientific, literary, artistic, or political 
                value. Second, the case law of recent decades strongly indicates 
                that the printed word, which includes words on a computer screen, 
                can never be obscene &mdash; no matter how raunchy or shocking. Only 
                pictures and films have been the subject of prosecution in recent 
                years. Third, the Supreme Court made clear that indecent (as opposed 
                to obscene) communications could be regulated to protect minors, 
                but could not be banned. (174)
            </blockquote>
            <p>Wallace and Mangan went on to argue that the government was trying 
              to regulate Internet providers the same way it regulated broadcasting. 
              They disputed that analogy, saying "Bandwidth on the Net is unlimited, 
              and the government's permission is not required to attach a server 
              to it in the same way as a radio or television station. Content 
              providers on the Internet are publishers, not broadcasters" (175).</p>
            <p>Wallace and Mangan could argue little beyond their arguments as 
              to the vagueness of the CDA and the likely impending legal battles 
              in the year ahead regarding the controversial law. Many of their 
              arguments were validated by the majority opinion in the following 
              year's Supreme Court decision in <i>Reno v. ACLU</i> (1997), a decision 
              made over a year after the publication of their book.</p>
            <p>In a 7-2 decision in July 1997, the Supreme Court struck down the 
              CDA as being unconstitutionally vague and legally problematic. In 
              the majority opinion, Justice Stevens wrote, </p>
            <blockquote>We are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision 
                that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the 
                content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentially 
                harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount 
                of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and 
                to address to one another. That burden on adult speech is unacceptable 
                if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective 
                in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted 
                to serve. (<i>Reno v. ACLU</i>)
            </blockquote>
            <p>In terms of protecting minors from Internet pornography, the Court 
              echoed its ruling from the 1968 case <i>Ginsburg v. New York</i>, 
              which placed the primary reponsibility for shielding children from 
              inappropriate content on parents.<i> The</i> Court continued by 
              affirming Wallace and Mangan's assertion that the the government 
              had no place regulating cyberspace as a broadcast medium: "In [<i>Red 
              Lion Broadcasting v. FCC</i> (1969) and <i>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation</i> 
              (1978)], the Court relied on the history of extensive government 
              regulation of the broadcast medium, the scarcity of available frequencies 
              at its inception, and its 'invasive' nature. Those factors are not 
              present in cyberspace" (<i>Reno v. ACLU</i>).</p>
            <p>The Court also made a cursory mention of the community standards 
              issue raised by the <i>Thomas</i> case: "Moreover, the 'community 
              standards' criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication 
              available to a nation-wide audience will be judged by the standards 
              of the community most likely to be offended by the message" (<i>Reno 
              v. ACLU</i>). However, the Court did not make any kind of judgement 
              in that arena, so it is possible that the <i>Thomas</i> case, or 
              one similar to it, could eventually appear before the high court 
              to finally resolve that question &mdash; if the Court even has an answer 
              for it.</p>
            <p>The Court concluded its opinion with the following, echoing its 
              commitment to preserving the marketplace of ideas:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Government apparently assumes that the unregulated 
                availability of &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; 
                material on the Internet is driving countless citizens away from 
                the medium because of the risk of exposing themselves or their 
                children to harmful material.</p>
              <p>We find this argument singularly unpersuasive. 
                The dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas contradicts 
                the factual basis of this contention. The record demonstrates 
                that the growth of the Internet has been and continues to be phenomenal. 
                As a matter of constitutional tradition, in the absence of evidence 
                to the contrary, we presume that governmental regulation of the 
                content of speech is more likely to interfere with the free exchange 
                of ideas than to encourage it. The interest in encouraging freedom 
                of expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical 
                but unproven benefit of censorship. (<i>Reno v. ACLU</i>)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The First Amendment was created to preserve speech that the majority 
              might not approve. While pornography is likely not exactly what 
              the Founding Fathers had in mind, it must be preserved, as cutting 
              it off (like the CDA attempted to) would lead once to the dangerous 
              "slippery slope" restricting the people's freedom of speech further 
              and further until there was little left that <i>was</i> protected.</p>
            <p>The key to evaluating future Internet law and policy is to apply 
              the proper analogy &mdash; and to treat it no differently from other 
              media. Hopefully, the Supreme Court, as well as lower courts, will 
              continue to promote the philosophy of the marketplace of ideas, 
              because, good or bad, the Internet is the <i>ultimate</i> marketplace.</p>
            <p>It's time for our congressmen to go shopping.</p>
