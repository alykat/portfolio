            <h2>Empire, thy name is McFarlane</h2>
            <h4>State Press Magazine / March 4, 1999</h4>
            <p>The most powerful man in comics is deceptively normal. 
            <p>Todd McFarlane is rich, too &mdash; rich enough to pay $2.7 million for 
              St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire's 70th home run baseball. And $600,000 
              more for Nos. 1, 63, 67, 68 and 69, along with Chicago Cubs right 
              fielder Sammy Sosa's Nos. 33, 61 and 66. 
            <p>Sitting in an armchair in his Tempe office in a room filled with 
              toys, McFarlane wears a polo shirt, jeans and sandals. His keychain, 
              on the table in front of him, has a Smith's grocery "Fresh Values" 
              card attached to it. He drives a dented 1992 car. He's a big fan 
              of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. 
            <p>His "aw-shucks" manner and casual appearance belie the empire he's 
              built. He comes across as just a comic book guy. The words "powerful" 
              and "mogul" just don't fit. 
            <p>McFarlane, 37, created the comic book Spawn, owns McFarlane Toys 
              and McFarlane Entertainment and is one of the founders of Image 
              Comics. In 1997, Forbes estimated his net worth at $75 million. 
            <p>"I think he's very smart," said his wife, Wanda Kolomyjec. "He's 
              like the Tortoise versus the Hare, and he's done very well. I'm 
              proud of him." 
            <p>Although Wizard, a popular comics trade magazine, labeled him "the 
              most powerful" last year, McFarlane really didn't move into the 
              national eye until January, when he was the "anonymous buyer" who 
              bought nine home run baseballs &mdash; six belonging to McGwire, three 
              from Sosa &mdash; in assorted auctions and private deals. Now he's got 
              them in a safety deposit box and plans to take them on tour later 
              this year. 
            <p>McFarlane was also up for a Grammy last week for his animation 
              work on Pearl Jam's music video "Do the Evolution." He lost out 
              to Madonna's "Ray of Light.&quot; 
            <h3>Finding a Niche</h3> 
            <p>McFarlane was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but spent 12 years 
              in California before his family moved back to Calgary when he was 
              14. 
            <p>Although McFarlane wasn't a big comic book collector when he was 
              a kid, he said he clearly remembers the day he started actively 
              buying comic books. He was 17 and was browsing the turn racks at 
              a grocery store near his Calgary home. His purchases that day: Amazing 
              Spider-Man #167, Dr. Strange #23, Black Panther #3, Marvel Tales 
              #77, an issue of Marvel Super-Heroes with the Hulk and an issue 
              of The Incredible Hulk. 
            <p>"I was collecting bubble gum cards and other things," he said. 
              "It was just part of collecting. Once I got those (comic books) 
              &mdash; I think I got about five that day &mdash; the floodgate went <i>ptooosh!</i>" 
              He spread his arms wide, mimicking an explosion. "I became just 
              psycho about comics after that." 
            <p>As much as he liked comics, though, baseball was his first love. 
            <p>McFarlane played center field through little leagues in California, 
              then in the "majors" when he moved back to Calgary. He got a baseball 
              scholarship to Eastern Washington State University and briefly played 
              in the San Diego Padres' minor league system. 
            <p>Al Simmons, who would later become one of his business partners, 
              was his roommate and baseball teammate. 
            <p>"(When I roomed with him in college,) Todd was very low-key, very 
              easygoing," Simmons said. "I will say that describes him now. He's 
              very easygoing until you put a challenge in front of him. You wouldn't 
              know he was there unless you asked him a question, and then <i>watch 
              out!</i>" 
            <p>McFarlane called it quits with baseball before he finished college. 
            <p>"It's that little thing called talent," he said. "I tried to go 
              out. I went to college. I even wound up playing for the Padres minor 
              league system &mdash; I was good enough to do that. I just wasn't good 
              enough. I wish I was … You just have to move on. 
            <p>"When they said, 'You suck as a ballplayer,' then I was like, 'Well, 
              OK. Gotta go do something else.'" 
            <h3>Breaking in ... and breaking out</h3> 
            <p>McFarlane spent his last two years of college sending out portfolios 
              and art samples to comics companies across the United States and 
              Canada. He estimated that he mailed off about 40 packages a month 
              during that time. 
            <p>Getting all the rejections was tough. 
            <p>"It was rough, and I was keeping track of everything," he said. 
              "I had a little chart: I sent out like 750 packages and half of 
              them got no responses and half of them got rejections. 
            <p>"My wife was cleaning out the closet the other day and came across 
              a bag of rejection letters. I used to carry them (around), and I'd 
              pour them on the table, moaning, 'I sent out two packages, and I 
              don't have a job and I'm discouraged.' I used to literally have 
              my bag full, and I'd just go <i>pkeeewwwf!</i>" He montioned as 
              though he were dumping the contents of a bag on the table. 
            <p>"I somehow made it," he continued, shrugging his shoulders. "You've 
              got to persevere, right? You're not going to get a job your first 
              two cracks at it." 
            <p>Just before McFarlane graduated from college in spring 1984, Marvel 
              Comics offered him the opportunity to pencil an 11-page back-up 
              story in the comic book Coyote. 
            <p>"I guess you could say that my big break was getting into comic 
              books," he said. "I mean you've got to get your toe in (the door). 
              My first job was in probably May of 1984 &mdash; I actually got <i>paid</i> 
              for my first job. 
            <p>"But my first real big break probably was doing the Hulk comic 
              book, because you're doing a character that almost everyone has 
              heard of." 
            <p>McFarlane pencilled several issues of Marvel's Incredible Hulk, 
              then did a few issues of DC Comics' Detective Comics and Batman: 
              Year Two. 
            <p>In the meantime, he married Kolomyjec, his high school sweetheart, 
              in July 1985. 
            <p>"I've known him since I was 13," she said. "I guess you could say 
              we grew up together." 
            <p>Despite her husband's profession, Kolomyjec, a former biology teacher, 
              said she doesn't read comic books: "Didn't before and still don't 
              now." 
            <p>McFarlane said moving up the ladder in terms of drawing prominent 
              characters taught him a certain degree of cynicism about promotions 
              in the comics industry. 
            <p>"So you start climbing the ladder in promotions and comic books. 
              (The companies) don't give you money &mdash; but they give you characters," 
              he added. "They knew which character was the favorite for each guy. 
              So when (an artist) would come in there, (the editors) would say, 
              'OK, his favorite's Green Lantern.' And when the artist would ask 
              for more money, (the editors) would say, 'Can't do it. But if you 
              keep your nose straight, we've got the Green Lantern annual coming, 
              and we haven't picked the team yet, and there's a chance...' 
            <p>"And the (artist) would go floating out the door. He never did 
              do the Green Lantern, and he didn't get a raise." 
            <p>McFarlane's strategy for getting jobs was to make his name and 
              face known in all the offices at DC and Marvel Comics, to the point 
              where he would frequently stop by and ask what opportunities may 
              have popped up. 
            <p>That's how he got Spider-Man, one of Marvel's oldest and most well-known 
              characters. McFarlane's work on the title catapulted the Spider-books 
              to the top of the sales charts &mdash; and made McFarlane a superstar 
              in the comics world. 
            <p>"It seems weird, but Spider-Man was really in a disarray when I 
              got there," he said. "They had the three books &mdash; Amazing (Spider-Man), 
              Spectacular…, Web of… &mdash; and, for whatever reason, they were changing 
              the creative team over and over and over and over. I just happened 
              to really be in the right place at the right time. 
            <p>"I went over to Marvel looking for another job, and literally stuck 
              my head in all the editors' offices. That's how you get jobs. 'Oh, 
              yeah, so-and-so just quit last week. You want to do the book?' You 
              don't really push people off books. It just happens to be people 
              leaving or deadlines or whatever. My very first regular job I got 
              was because someone, like, died. You need those breaks. 
            <p>"The only thing that (everyone else) did say was, 'Todd, don't 
              go in the Spider-Man office. You don't want to work in the Spider-Man 
              office.' I was like, 'Oh, cool. I'm going in the Spider-Man office.' 
            <p>"They ended up offering me Amazing Spider-Man, which to me was 
              like the granddaddy." 
            <p>McFarlane spent about two years on Amazing, then moved over to 
              launch the adjective-less Spider-Man in September 1990. Selling 
              more than 2.5 million copies, it became the best-selling comic of 
              all time. (It was later passed up by the launch of 1991's X-Force 
              #1 and by X-Men #1, each with five variant covers by Rob Liefeld 
              and Jim Lee, respectively.) 
            <p>He credits a lot of his success in becoming a favorite with fans 
              to his consistency on the book &mdash; and to good timing. 
            <p>"I found that if you follow a bad act, you actually look better," 
              McFarlane said. "If you follow a good act…? Ooooh &mdash; It's a little 
              bit tougher. Not too many people have followed a man who's made 
              a career out of any book and actually done better. 
            <p>"But if you follow inconsistency, all of the sudden it's easier 
              to shine. One of the reasons why I think people paid attention to 
              my work was that no one was really staying on the books for more 
              than two or three months at a time. 
            <p>"And then I ended up doing some arty-farty stuff on it that they 
              liked." 
            <h3>Birth of an empire</h3> 
            <p>McFarlane left Spider-Man in August 1991. But he wasn't just leaving 
              the Spider-titles. He was leaving Marvel. 
            <p>"Comic books have been around for about 50 years, and (the companies) 
              have been getting rid of us (artists and writers) one at a time 
              any time we had a squabble or somebody had a disagreement or one 
              of us wanted to stand up for our beliefs," McFarlane said. "We just 
              kept quitting one at a time, and it was easy to replace one person 
              at a time." 
            <p>From August 1991 to February 1992, McFarlane laid the foundation 
              for his own comic book company. In early 1992, he and six other 
              popular Marvel artists officially quit their jobs and established 
              Image Comics. 
            <p>"I left because I just got tired of the system," he said. "Every 
              system has its 'Twelve Rules,' and it can't see beyond them. It's 
              a pecking order … There is no 'Mr. or Mrs. IBM.' There is no 'Mr. 
              Warner.' There is no 'Mr. Time.' It's just a company. You come to 
              McFarlane Toys or McFarlane Enterprises, you can actually have a 
              discussion with the guy whose name's on it." 
            <p>The seven Image founders &mdash; McFarlane, Lee, Liefeld, Erik Larsen, 
              Whilce Portacio, Marc Silvestri, Jim Valentino &mdash; also made a stand 
              for artists and writers to retain ownership of the characters they 
              create. 
            <p>At Image, writers <i>would</i> maintain ownership. Their stand 
              eventually led DC and Marvel to give the green light on more creator-owned 
              projects and to begin compensating writers and artists for their 
              original creations. 
            <p>The departure of Marvel's most popular artists &mdash; McFarlane on Spider-Man, 
              Liefeld on X-Force, Lee on X-Men, Portacio on Uncanny X-Men, Silvestri 
              on Wolverine &mdash; got Marvel's attention. 
            <p>"Seven people leaving at once is a lot different than just one 
              person," McFarlane said. "And the seven people were some of their 
              elite &mdash; we were 'the boys.' We accounted for a vast majority of 
              their top sellers. We were on their heavy-hitter books. It really 
              made an impact when we left. 
            <p>"Let's take ASU as an example. If they were doing something that 
              the student body perceived of as wrong and one or two guys go, 'Screw 
              it, I'm not coming back next year,' what does management care? If 
              43,000 people decided not to show up, then they've got a serious 
              problem on their hands. 
            <p>"It's one of the reasons why we have unions, and it's one of the 
              reasons why unions strike." 
            <p>Politics aside, when McFarlane wasn't working on the business side 
              of building up Image, he was polishing up a character that has proven 
              to be his Holy Grail. 
            <p>Spawn. 
            <p>The character debuted in May 1992 in the comic of the same name. 
              A decorated American soldier who was assassinated by order of the 
              government, Al Simmons sold his soul to the devil to be able to 
              come back to Earth to be with his wife. The devil had a sense of 
              humor and sent Al back five years after his death. His wife had 
              remarried to his best friend and had a daughter. And Al, now an 
              amnesiac Hellspawn, was haunted by fragments of memories he couldn't 
              place. 
            <p>"He's got a bit of a bad attitude, like me. But it's not completely 
              autobiographical," McFarlane said. "He's got a lot of forces around 
              him &mdash; big forces, like Heaven and Hell and all that theology stuff 
              &mdash; and he doesn't really care about it. All he really cares about 
              is his little, finite world and his little family. And he wants 
              to get back to his wife and lead a normal life. But he has to deal 
              with all this stuff around him; it's just a byproduct of his existence. 
            <p>"To some extent, I could say that it's all metaphors: the government 
              and big corporate America all think that they've got you, and because 
              they're bigger than you they should be able to dictate the way that 
              you live." 
            <p>Not as polished as the cape-and-tights set, Spawn functions best 
              as an anti-hero. 
            <p>"(Spawn's) not a hero in the truest sense of the word," McFarlane 
              said. "He's a guy that I believe to be more realistic, if you will, 
              in terms of if you strip away the cape and the costume and all that, 
              underneath it all he's just a guy that if you push him, he pushes 
              back. He's small and confined and rough and … kind of unpolished. 
              Superman is, like, completely smooth. He's always like, 'I know 
              how to handle this situation.' 
            <p>"Spawn's quite the opposite. Spawn, I believe, is more like one 
              of us. If tomorrow a bolt of lighting came and hit this guy right 
              here, he's be a helluva student that takes good photos and can lift 
              tall buildings. But I don't know that he would be able to then figure 
              out how to stop the strife and the horror that's going on in Bosnia. 
              Just because you have power, just because you can lift a mountain, 
              doesn't mean you have the capacity to stop human atrocities." 
            <p>Starting with the first issue, Spawn, as well as the other Image 
              comics, burst onto the scene on high-quality paper that did justice 
              to the computer coloring (then not an industry standard) and the 
              artists' work. McFarlane credits Image with raising the bar on artistic 
              standards throughout the industry. 
            <p>"I think we upgraded, artistically, the way that people look at 
              comic books in terms of paper, the computer coloring that we did, 
              the presentation of some of our characters and the artistic impression," 
              he said. 
            <p>"And then, just the mere fact that we existed and that we continued 
              to exist started making the other companies, like Marvel and DC, 
              a little bit nervous. So they upgraded their standard freelance 
              contracts because they didn't want to lose people. And the truth 
              was many of those people who (supposedly) were going to leave never 
              intended to leave &mdash; and actually hated us (the founders of Image). 
            <p>"But our existence got them a pay raise and better working conditions. 
              And people began to see that they could get along without 'Big Mom' 
              and 'Big Dad.'" 
            <p>In the end, though, even some of the Image founders couldn't resist 
              the call of "Big Mom and Dad." 
            <p>In 1996, Lee and Liefeld returned to Marvel to draw and write the 
              company's Heroes Reborn storyline, featuring a relaunch of the Fantastic 
              Four, Avengers and Captain America titles. Last fall, Lee sold his 
              WildStorm division of Image to DC Comics and now operates under 
              their label. Larsen is now the writer on Marvel's Wolverine and 
              DC's Aquaman. Liefeld was recently named the new penciller and co-writer 
              on Marvel's Cable (a character he helped create before leaving Marvel 
              in 1992). 
            <p>McFarlane was less than glowing in his comments about his former 
              co-founders' activities. 
            <p>"I don't care how these guys want to spin doctor it," he said. 
              "It's always amusing to me. First Rob and Jim went and did the Marvel 
              'Heroes Reborn' thing, and they were all 'Well, we grew up with 
              these characters, and we love them and…' And it's always a bunch 
              of crap. The reason they went and made a deal with Marvel Comics 
              was that they got a ton of cash. End of the conversation. Finito. 
            <p>"Rob Liefeld did what he did, God bless him. And Jim Lee did what 
              he did, God bless him. But they're the competition now." 
            <p>McFarlane wouldn't completely rule out the possiblity of working 
              for DC or Marvel again, but he said he doubted he'd ever go back. 
            <p>"I mean, if I completely fall, crash on my face, lose every single 
              company and nobody wants to give me a job, would I come crawling 
              on my hands and knees? Yep," he said. "But I've set myself up so 
              that the world would have to, like, blow up for all my eggs to disintegrate. 
            <p>"Let me tell you, I love Batman. I love Spider-Man. But I don't 
              care what they put on the table. I wouldn't go back to those characters. 
              I've tasted freedom." 
            <h3>Building a better toy</h3> 
            <p>With Spawn dominating the charts, McFarlane was soon given the 
              opportunity to merchandise his newly popular character. Toymakers 
              such as Mattel, Hasbro and Playmates offered him toy contracts. 
            <p>Because McFarlane wanted to have creative control over the plastic 
              incarnations of his characters &mdash; something other companies weren't 
              willing to give him &mdash; he decided to create his own toy company. 
            <p>And Todd Toys was born. 
            <p>The company introduced the first line of Spawn toys in fall 1994. 
              The action figures in the series were more detailed and better articulated 
              than many of the most popular toys on the market, and McFarlane's 
              toys became a hit. 
            <p>"You can't beat them with money and you can't beat them with exposure," 
              he said. "The only thing you can do as a small guy to beat the big 
              guys is to build a better mousetrap. That's it. 
            <p>"It's served us well for five or six years now, and it's kind of 
              solidified us as kind of a strong-niche company. If we can beat 
              them aesthetically, then the average person then can look at our 
              toys compared to their toys and go, 'Well, yeah, your toys are better.' 
              I've got a chance, a chance to sell them something." 
            <p>In the past five years, the company has added new characters, further 
              developed its toymaking technique and undergone a name change (to 
              McFarlane Toys, because of a trademark conflict with Mattel). Last 
              year, they produced the heavily anticipated X-Files toy line, as 
              well as introduced other toy lines based on the rock group Kiss 
              and on movie monsters. 
            <p>This year, McFarlane Toys will release action figures based on 
              the movies Austin Powers and Yellow Submarine (the latter featuring 
              the Beatles looking almost identical to their cartoon counterparts) 
              and the video game Metal Gear Solid, as well as make more Spawn 
              and movie monsters toys. 
            <p>"As the head of a company &mdash; as much as I like li'l Spawnie because 
              he's my guy &mdash; I have to be smart enough not to put all my eggs in 
              the proverbial basket," he said. "If nobody likes Spawn in two years, 
              then I've done my company a disservice by being too egotistical 
              to let go of my baby." 
            <h3>Silver and gold</h3> 
            <p>Spawn made the leap to the big screen in sumer 1997 with a $100 
              million-grossing live-action movie. With one movie under his belt 
              and two on the way (a <i>Spawn</i> sequel and a different movie 
              for Columbia Pictures), McFarlane has learned from experience and 
              already has a plan to make the next Spawn movie an even bigger hit. 
            <p>"The next movie will be R-rated and kind of a thriller movie, along 
              the lines of <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>," he said. "We're going 
              to get rid of all the special effects and make it more of a boogeyman 
              kind of story. That should, hopefully, hook in some new eyeballs. 
              And if you do another nice movie soundtrack, you get some new people 
              coming in just because of the band that you happen to have." 
            <p>Spawn also made its small-screen debut in May 1997 with the debut 
              of <i>Todd McFarlane's Spawn</i> on HBO. 
            <p>Both the show and the comic series are a family affair. McFarlane's 
              4-year-old daughter Kate is the voice of Cyan, Spawn's ex-wife's 
              daughter, in the show. The character Cyan, featured in both the 
              comics and the TV show, is named after McFarlane's 7-year-old daughter, 
              born just before his move to Image. Cyan's mother and Spawn's ex-wife, 
              Wanda, is named after McFarlane's wife. 
            <p>"I'm not sure the character is any more closely related (to me) 
              than just the name," Kolomyjec said about her namesake. "Same thing 
              with the little girl (in the comic) named Cyan, although with Cyan 
              it was a little more immortalized because when he started Spawn, 
              he made Cyan the character the age that our daughter was at the 
              same time. 
            <p>"A lot of the stuff that you read in that book where she's doing 
              things and saying things Todd did pick up from our daughter." 
            <p>Spawn himself is named after former baseball teammate Simmons, 
              who now tours the country to promote the company. 
            <p>"When he called me up (in 1991), he did not tell me I was going 
              to be the lead character," he said. "But I was honored by it. I 
              mean, my name was going to be in a comic by Todd McFarlane. I thought 
              it was just going to be something like 'And then the garbage truck 
              ran over Al Simmons...' 
            <p>"It's a real honor. I mean, sports figures become like superheroes, 
              but to be named a 'real' superhero is a real honor." 
            <p>Spawn's HBO incarnation has received good reviews thus far in its 
              two-year run, even winning an Emmy. 
            <p>And, in an odd way, it led to another venture for McFarlane: music 
              videos. 
            <p>In 1998, McFarlane was approached to help create the video for 
              the Pearl Jam song "Do the Evolution" &mdash; the usually anti- capitalistic 
              band's first music video in five years. 
            <p>"Pearl Jam isn't really big on doing any kind of commercial stuff," 
              McFarlane said. They hadn't made a video for five or six years, 
              and the record label was going, 'You know, it'd be nice if you guys 
              could advertise something. It'd be nice, because we'd like to promote 
              this (album).' And so (the band) cracked after five years. But, 
              again, they didn't really want to star in a video because it seemed 
              kind of passé to them. So they were trying to figure out how to 
              advertise and how to make a video and not star in it. 
            <p>"Eddie Vedder, the lead singer, was at home watching the HBO (<i>Spawn</i>) 
              series, and (he was impressed enough that he had his people call 
              up McFarlane) … Eddie and I talked on the phone about what we wanted 
              to do, I hired some people to help me with it, and first time out 
              of the gate I get a Grammy nomination. Great, Todd! Seems like the 
              music business was easier than I thought! 
            <p>"Nah … Again, it's just dumb luck. I might go another 20 years 
              before I get another nomination. Maybe it'd be better to quit while 
              I'm ahead." 
            <p>McFarlane doesn't seem to be quitting the music business any time 
              soon. Last year, he drew the cover for the most recent Korn album 
              (and appeared with the band at Tower Records in September to sign 
              autographs). His work on the band's latest music video recently 
              debuted on MTV. 
            <p>Before the Grammy ceremony, though, he put his accomplishments 
              and relative fame in perspective: 
            <p>"I'm only going to be able to sneak towards two people: Celine 
              Dion and Shania Twain. They're Canadian, I'm Canadian &mdash; we can go 
              and talk Canadian. They're the only ones I can talk to. Everyone 
              else will be like, 'Go away, <i>Ball Boy</i>.'" 
            <p>So what does the "ball boy" have planned for this year? 
            <p>"Workin' on a movie for Columbia, workin' on the sequel for Spawn, 
              got the third season for HBO comin' out, got the new toys comin', 
              got four or five new comic magazines coming out this year," he said. 
              "So don't worry about me. We're busy."</p>
